In this paper we propose P2P-Tube, a video sharing web platform, similar with YouTube, which uses Next-Share, a video sharing technology developed within European project P2P-Next. This project's goal is to build the next generation peer-to-peer content delivery platform. Next-Share is based on two browser plugins which provide video-on-demand and live streaming through BitTorrent peer-to-peer protocols. Users are able to retrieve video content not only from a number of delivery servers, which assume the role of \textit{seeders}, but also concomitantly from other users, which are \textit{leechers}.
