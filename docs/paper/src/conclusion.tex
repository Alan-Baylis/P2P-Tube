We designed and implemented P2P-Tube, a video-sharing platform which supports the new Next-Share content delivery technology from P2P-Next. The most common features needed to implement a video-sharing site are found on this platform which allows users to share their thoughts through videos. It ensures scalability for a few thousands users by using the Next-Share technology, which moves part of the overhead to the users, and by using a distributed system of content ingestion machines (CIS). It offers organization of video assets through categories and social features through users, comments and voting. Community contributions are encouraged, because P2P-Tube is free and open-source.
