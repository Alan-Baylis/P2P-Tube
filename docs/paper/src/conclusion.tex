The web service solution to use depends a lot on the application requirements. Whether communication footprint is vital? Whether the service needs to published through a discovery service or not? Whether the service functionality needs to be described for other services or clients? For our application a RESTful web service best fitted, mainly because of our protocol simplicity and our need for a low communication overhead. Also a discovery feature was not required.

WS-Security offers a lot of features in comparison with HTTPS with TLS/SSL, like end-to-end communication and message integrity. If this are not required then HTTPS offers a lower overhead and is recommended to be used.
