P2P-Tube is a video sharing web platform, similar with YouTube, which uses
Next-Share, a video sharing technology developed within European project
[P2P-Next](http://www.p2p-next.org/). This project's goal is to build the next
generation peer-to-peer content delivery platform. Next-Share is based on two
browser plugins which provide video-on-demand and live streaming through
BitTorrent peer-to-peer protocols. Users are able to retrieve video content not
only from a number of delivery servers, which assume the role of seeders, but
also concomitantly from other users, which are leechers in BitTorrent parlance.
